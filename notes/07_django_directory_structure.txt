directory structure
-------------------

project name -> project1  

- project1 (outer project folder/root directory)
    - project1 (inner project folder/default application created by django)
        - __init__.py
        - asgi.py
        - settings.py 
        - urls.py
        - wsgi.py
    - manage.py

__init__.py -> The folder which contains __init__.py file is considered as python package

wsgi.py -> WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how
web applications can be chained together to process one request. WSGI provided a standard for synchronous Python apps.

asgi.py -> ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between
async-capable python web servers, frameworks, and applications. ASGI provides standard for both Asynchronous and synchronous apps.

settings.py -> This file contains all the information or data about the project settings
e.g. database config information, installed applications, validators etc

urls.py -> this file contains information of url attached with application

manage.py -> it is automatically created in each Django project. It is Django's command line utility also sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
environment variable so that it points to your project's settings.py file. Generally, when working on a single Django Project, it's easier
to use manage.py than django-admin
