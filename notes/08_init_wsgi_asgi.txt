__init__.py -> the folder which contains __init__.py is considered as the python package and there is no code in this file.

wsgi.py
------- 
- When the WSGI server loads your application, django needs to import the settings module, thats where your entire application 
is defined
- Django uses DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to locate the appropiate settings module
- It must contain dotted path to the settings module
- You can use different value for development and production, it all depends on how you organize your settings.
- if the variable isn't set, the default wsgi.py sets it to mysite.settings, where mysite is the name of your project. Thats how 
runserver discovers default settings file by default
